There are two folders. A Vulkan demo applied the uniform buffer and descriptor set in Vulkan API. I wrote a Uniform Buffer Object in the vertex shader to apply the MVP transformation.
After that, I wrote an updateUniformBuffer function to update the uniform buffer every frame which make the geometry spin around in 3D.
The second folder contain a blender wave demo which applied different kinds of nodes including colorRamp, gradient texture, noise texture and voronoi texture to make it more photorealistic.
